# go-vscode-config-best-practice

Best practice of go-oriented vscode configuration. Ready to Go preset.

Rules still needs to be documented, but this preset should speed up your initial setup and your development process as well.

### Getting started. The quick way.
1. Install [code-settings-sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync). Reload the editor.
2. add `"sync.gist": "e113f79b1110591c72d89eda2e92fe39"` in your vscode config.
3. Press cmd+shift+P for Mac or ctrl+shift+P for Linux, select `Sync: download` (shift+alt+D also may work)
4. Reload your editor.
5. You're ready to Go ;)

**NOTE**: if you want to sync your settings later, remove `sync.gist` option or create a new gist and set your own ID.
